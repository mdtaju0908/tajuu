## Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the website
3. For development, you can use any code editor of your choice

## Customization

### Adding Real Images

Replace the SVG placeholders in the `images` folder with your actual images. Make sure to maintain the same filenames or update the references in the HTML files.

### Updating Content

Edit the HTML files to update the content with your personal information:

- `index.html` - Homepage content
- `about.html` - Biography and professional details
- `projects.html` - Your work and projects
- `blog.html` - Blog posts and articles
- `gallery.html` - Photos and media appearances
- `contact.html` - Contact information and form

### Styling

The website uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theming. You can modify the colors, fonts, and other design elements by editing the variables in the `:root` section of `css/style.css`.

## Backend Integration

To make the contact form and blog functionality fully operational, you'll need to implement a backend solution. Some options include:

1. **Contact Form**:
   - Use a form submission service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or FormSubmit
   - Implement a custom backend using Node.js, PHP, or another server-side language

2. **Blog**:
   - Integrate a headless CMS like Contentful, Sanity, or Strapi
   - Use a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby
   - Implement a custom CMS with a database
